# Early Wishlist Adoption & Its Impact on Revenue, Retention, and LTV

## Problem Statement
Early wishlist adoption is believed to drive higher engagement and revenue, but most new users (<10%) do not use it. We analyzed whether early wishlist use predicts higher LTV and retention.

## Data & Methodology
- Dataset: 5 months of e-commerce event logs (Oct 2019 – Feb 2020)
- Users: New users (signup inferred from first event)
- Metrics: Purchase rate, orders per user, revenue per user, active days (30-day window)
- Analysis: Python (Pandas), SQL, Matplotlib

## Key Findings
- Wishlist users show 35% higher purchase rate than non-users
- Revenue per user is 40% higher for early wishlist adopters
- Average active days: higher among wishlist users
- Conclusion: Early wishlist adoption is a strong predictor of long-term value

## Recommendations
1. Onboarding Nudge after 2nd product view (+10–15% adoption)
2. Reminder Automation on day-3 (+15–25% conversion)
3. UI Optimization: Always-visible wishlist icon, reduce friction (+30% adoption)
4. Metric Monitoring: Track wishlist-to-purchase weekly
5. Prioritized Experiments: Focus on onboarding nudges and UI tweaks first

## Tools
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), SQL, Google Colab

## Insights
Early feature adoption can be leveraged to drive measurable revenue and retention impact. Product decisions backed by analytics maximize LTV.
